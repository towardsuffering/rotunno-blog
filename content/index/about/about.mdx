import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am passionate about learning new concepts and applying new workflows that challenge the old mental model.

I try to "𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘰𝘹" by seeking to understand other people's truths and trying to make their truths my own.

My experience in corporate culture is drawn from getting involved with retail banking, a financial technology startup, and a global economic firm.

My career objective is to data mine various asset allocation strategies and test for portfolio risk and performance based on expected returns. Ultimately, my end goal is to increase financial transparency and financial literacy as a career Business Applications Engineer.
